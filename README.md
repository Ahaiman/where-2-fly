## Description

>  Following COVID-19, returning to the flight routine can be confusing.
>  Where is it allowed ? Where is it forbidden ?
>  In which countries is the morbidity situation high? Which one is not?
>  **"Where2Fly"** provides you the most up-to-date information, as of today.

## How Does It Work?

Choose the country you want to receive information about by clicking the plane icon.
Countries which do not allow entry, will have the description "No entry at this time", and a lock icon next to it.

Otherwise, click on the details reference for more information about COVID-19 state in the country.
If you are interested in booking the flight, go ahead and add it to your cart, using the plus icon.
